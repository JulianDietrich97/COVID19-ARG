# Delayed Correlation: Vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 in Argentina. 
####  Correlation analysis, regression analysis & time serie analysis

## Introduction:
Over the past two decades, the world has witnessed various outbreaks of infectious diseases. The Ebola virus, Influenza A (H1N1), SARS, MERS, and the Zika virus have had a significant global impact in terms of economic disruption and public health on both local and global scales.
By late 2019, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged. This virus, a member of the Coronaviridae family, was first discovered and isolated in the city of Wuhan, China. SARS-CoV-2 possesses a viral envelope and is classified as a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus.
SARS-CoV-2 was initially identified from patient samples on December 31, 2019. In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease caused by this virus COVID-19. Due to its global implications, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic.
As of August 2023, approximately 769 million cases of coronavirus have been recorded worldwide, with an estimated 7 million deaths on a global scale.
As highlighted in the research published in the Vaccine journal in 2021, “Previous studies have shown that vaccine, as a powerful weapon to control an infectious disease, can notably allay or defeat diseases caused by pathogens”. There are numerous examples that support this statement, such as Smallpox, Polio, Measles, among others.

## Hypothesis
In consideration of the previously established theoretical framework, a primary hypothesis is formulated as follows:
Primary Hypothesis: "Vaccination results in a reduction of COVID-19 cases in Argentina."
Expanding upon this primary hypothesis, three additional hypotheses are proposed:

  •	Hypothesis 1: "There exists a significant and negative correlation between the vaccination rate and the number of COVID-19 cases."
  
  
  •	Hypothesis 2: "There exists a significant and negative correlation between the proportion of immunized individuals and the number of COVID-19 cases."
  
  
  •	Hypothesis 3: "Both relationships are characterized by a specific delay during which a maximum negative correlation is observed. 
  
  
This delay represents the time it takes for individual and collective immunization to have a noticeable impact at the population level."

## Methodology
The data were obtained from the vaccination dataset provided by Our World in Data [18], which utilizes the most recent official figures from government health ministries worldwide.
Correlation analyses were conducted among the selected variables, and regression models were proposed.
Finally, a time series analysis was performed, and two SARIMAX (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Variable) models were estimated—one with an exogenous variable and another without an exogenous variable.
